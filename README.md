## Overview

Zingen was built to represent a complete product presentation page, combining strong visual identity with clear information hierarchy. The layout highlights the app’s value proposition, main features, pricing plans, and call-to-action sections.

The design and structure were planned to resemble a real SaaS or mobile app marketing page rather than a simple study exercise.

## CSS Architecture

The styling is separated by responsibility to improve readability, maintenance, and scalability:

- `global.css` → global styles, resets, and variables  
- `utility.css` → reusable utility classes  
- `button.css` → buttons and interactions  
- `header.css` → navigation and header  
- `hero.css` → main hero section  
- `sections.css` → generic section styles  
- `about.css` → product presentation  
- `cards.css` → feature and content cards  
- `features.css` → advanced features layout  
- `pricing.css` → pricing plans  
- `download.css` → app download section  
- `footer.css` → footer layout  

All files are imported through `index.css`.
